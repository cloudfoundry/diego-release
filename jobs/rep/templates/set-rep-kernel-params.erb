# TCP_FIN_TIMEOUT
# This setting determines the time that must elapse before TCP/IP can release a closed connection and reuse
# its resources. During this TIME_WAIT state, reopening the connection to the client costs less than establishing
# a new connection. By reducing the value of this entry, TCP/IP can release closed connections faster, making more
# resources available for new connections. Addjust this in the presense of many connections sitting in the
# TIME_WAIT state:

echo 10 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fin_timeout

# TCP_TW_REUSE
# This allows reusing sockets in TIME_WAIT state for new connections when it is safe from protocol viewpoint.
# Default value is 0 (disabled). It is generally a safer alternative to tcp_tw_recycle

echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_tw_reuse

# NF_CONNTRACK_MAX
# Default value is 65536. We set it to a larger number to avoid running out of connections.
echo 262144 > /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_max

# Default value is 60 (seconds). We set it to a larger number to avoid connection issues with remote endpoints or
# firewalls which keep sessions for half-closed connections for longer than 1 minute.
