# this tiny template is so that only external_services ends up being the only
# thing in the resulting template. a template further down constructs it, but
# must do so by pulling in everything else (namely, all of the jobs and some
# properties) from cf-release.
#
# the border between cf and diego is ideally only this one property. so, this
# template declares it as the whole structure, and the result is then fed into
# diego's templates.
